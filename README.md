# <h1>JS-Advanced-s2i</h1>
The JavaScript Advanced project for Start2Impact

<p>The purpose is to check the quality of life in a city you like straight from your sofa, by a list of prameters and its own score. To do so, I envolved an external service, an API, which is <a href="https://teleport.org/">Teleport</a>.</p>

<p>Try it yourself <a href="https://cities-score.netlify.app" target="_blank">HERE</a>!</p>

# <h2>What's in there</h2>

<p>As the user type the name of a city of interest in the search bar, the page will show:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the total score of the city,</li>
  <li>a summary,</li>
  <li>a list of parameters to describe the most important aspects of the town</li>
</ul>

<p>Pay attenction please, the number of cities available is limited but you can find your dream city between the best 266 cities in the world!</p>

# <h2>What's underground</h2>

<p>let's talk about what's beneath the skin: the focal points of this project are the correct use of a third-part-API, because it was the first time for me, and the use of a bundler, like <a href="https://webpack.js.org" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, that was a bit hard to me to understand formerly.</p>
<p>
